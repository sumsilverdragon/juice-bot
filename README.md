# juice-bot
This is my final project for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 program. It's a simple chatbot, written in Python. The chatbot takes juice orders from the customer, by welcoming the customer with an image and asking the customer's name, responding to it, asking three questions to get the juice order, asks if you would like to place another order(until customer says no - while loop), and finally it reads the complete order back to the customer. Happy coding ðŸ¤–
